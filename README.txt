Hello reviewer!

I hope this qualifies. I tried to do my best and I hope I didn't break any rules.
I asked help of a friend for this for optimisation, as I couldn't optimise it myself and I ended up learning switch cases.
Aparrently they are more efficient in the machine-code level compared to else-ifs, so I hope it makes the cut, even though it is very smiliar.

The calculator also doesn't break with letters or anything, it just asks for the number / operator again.

Have fun calculating! o7
